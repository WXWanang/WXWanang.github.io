        <strong>Abstract</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>Open-Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) aims to transfer knowledge from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled
        target domain that contains unknown categories, thus facing the challenges of domain shift and unknown
        category recognition. While recent works have demonstrated the potential of causality for domain alignment,
        little exploration has been conducted on causal-inspired theoretical frameworks for OSDA. To fill this gap,
        we introduce the concept of <em>Susceptibility</em> and propose a novel <strong>C</strong>ounterfactual-based
        susceptibility risk framework for <strong>OSDA</strong>, termed <strong>COSDA</strong>. Specifically, COSDA
        consists of three novel components: (i) a <em>Susceptibility Risk Estimator (SRE)</em> for capturing causal
        information, along with comprehensive derivations of the computable theoretical upper bound, forming a risk
        minimization framework under the OSDA paradigm; (ii) a <em>Contrastive Feature Alignment (CFA)</em> module,
        which is theoretically proven based on mutual information to satisfy the <em>Exogeneity</em> assumption and
        facilitate cross-domain feature alignment; (iii) a <em>Virtual Multi-unknown-categories Prototype (VMP)</em>
        pseudo-labeling strategy, providing label information by measuring how similar samples are to known and
        multiple virtual unknown category prototypes, thereby assisting in open-set recognition and intra-class
        discriminative feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
        state-of-the-art performance.</p>

    <p>In this paper we build our framework for the MTDA pivoted around two key concepts: <i>feature aggregation</i> and
        <i>curriculum learning</i>.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Promising Way:</strong> We propose a structural causal model within the OSDA paradigm and perform
        theoretical derivations and algorithm design centered on the counterfactual probability of susceptibility.
        This addresses its optimizability, evaluability, and identifiability, thus presenting a principled causal
        framework for OSDA tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Systematic Theoretical Framework:</strong> We introduce a novel counterfactual-based
        risk—Susceptibility risk—along with its evaluator. A theoretically computable upper bound for the target
        domain’s susceptibility risk is derived within the OSDA paradigm.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Innovative Techniques:</strong> We identify an optimization objective that satisfies the Exogeneity
        causal assumption, which is recognized as maximizing the mutual information between the target sample and
        the source domain prototype. Based on this, we propose a Virtual Multi-unknown-categories Prototype (VMP)
        pseudo-labeling strategy and a Contrastiveinspired Feature Alignment (CFA) module.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Comprehensive Experiments:</strong> We validate the effectiveness of the model on three benchmark
        datasets, achieving improvements of 2.9%, 2.2%, and 1.0% respectively, compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA)
        algorithms. Ablation studies and experiments on synthetic datasets confirm the effectiveness of each
        proposed module

            In Sub-Figure (a), it describes the deployment of feature interventions. We add an
            intervention module utilizing Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) following feature C, executing an intervention
            via a nonlinear transformation of feature C. The feature distribution is a Gaussian distribution with
            parameterized mean and variance, as popularized by VIB (Kingma et al, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
            In Sub-Figure (b), the VMP and CFA are
            proposed to address Exogeneity. The central idea of VMP (1.-4.) is to build the centroids of all known and
            unknown classes, and then generate the pseudo label for samples by comparing the distance between samples
            and the centroids. CFA (5.) introduces the concept of feature alignment, which reduces the distance to the
            appropriate class centroid while maximizing the distance to the centroids of other classes, establishing
            class-level cross-domain feature alignment. Through adaptation, we align the features of known classes while
            also learning the decision boundary for unknown classes.
