Specifically, our self-supervised learning problem involves predicting the conclusive binding complex structure given a primary pocket and ligand, which is in line with the protein-ligand interaction process. To emphasize learning fundamental interactions, we employ a specific Transformer-based interaction module that utilizes individual pocket and ligand encoders in the modeling process. To ensure that the model learns interaction-aware protein and ligand representations, we use two distinct strategies in the pre-training process. The first pre-training objective is Atomic pairwise Distance map Prediction (ADP), where interaction distance map between atoms in the protein and ligand is employed to provide detailed supervision signals regarding their interactions. The other pre-training objective is Mask Ligand Reconstruction (MLR), in which the ligand representation extracted by a 3D pre-trained encoder is masked for reconstruction. By employing feature space masking and reconstruction instead of simply token or atom type masking, the model is more likely to capture richer semantic information, such as chemical and shape information, during the pre-training process.")]),i("h2",{attrs:{id:"experiments"}},[i("a",{attrs:{href:"#experiments","aria-hidden":"true"}},[i("span",{staticClass:"icon icon-link"})]),this._v("Experiments")]),i("p",[this._v("Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority of our method across various binding tasks, including protein-ligand affinity prediction, virtual screening and protein-ligand docking.")]),i("div",{staticStyle:{display:"flex","justify-content":"center"}},[i("img",{staticStyle:{"max-width":"50%"},attrs:{src:"/image/bindnet_result1.jpeg"}})]),i("div",{staticStyle:{display:"flex","justify-content":"center"}},[i("img",{staticStyle:{"max-width":"50%"},attrs:{src:"/image/bindnet_result2.jpeg"}})]),i("div",{staticStyle:{display:"flex","justify-content":"center"}},[i("img",{staticStyle:{"max-width":"50%"},attrs:{src:"/image/bindnet_result3.jpeg"}})])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);"function"==typeof c&&c(m),"function"==typeof u&&u(m);i.default=m.exports}}]);
